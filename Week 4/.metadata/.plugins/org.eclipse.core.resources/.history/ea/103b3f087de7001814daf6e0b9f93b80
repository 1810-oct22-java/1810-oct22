<h3>GET REQUEST</h3>
<i>Should never send sensitive information with a GET request</i>
<!-- 
HTML FORMS must have an action tag. When used with Servlets in the same
application context, we denote our action as the url-pattern for the servlet,
but without the / the method attribute also goes here, but is not required,
because without it, the method is assumed to be a GET request -->
<form method="get" action="httpInfo">
<input type = "text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
<input type = "password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
<input type = "submit" value = "GET!">
</form>


<h3>POST REQUEST</h3>
<form method = "post" action="httpInfo"></form>
<input type = "text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
<input type = "password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
<input type = "submit" value = "POST!">
