	<h1>A Discussion of Normal Forms</h1>
	<p class="lead">Normalization is a database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that seeks to eliminate redundant data and ensure dependency of data.</p>
</div>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<thead class="table-info">
		<tr>
			<th>Form</th>
			<th>Rules</th>
			<th>Example</th>			
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1st</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
				<li>Every table must have at least one unique (PK) key</li>
				<li>All fields must be Atomic fields - each field should only contain one value</li>
				<li>All columns must not repeat </li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
				<img src="images/NF1.jpg" alt="Normal Form 1">
				<p>In this example notice there is no primary (PK) key.  The NAME field also implies that first 
				name and last name are included as values in the field.  
				Also, note the children seem to have their own column.  This example violates Normal Form 1.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2nd</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Each table must satisfy 1st Normal Form</li>
					<li>Must have a single column primary key - to prevent partial dependencies</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
				<img src="images/address.jpg" alt="Address Table"><img src="images/streets.jpg" alt="Streets Table">
				<p>In this example, notice the ADDRESS table has a composite key 
				consisting of HOUSE_NUMBER and STREET_NAME.  If the STREETS table had a foreign (FK) key between its NAME field and 
				ADDRESS.STREET_NAME then a partial dependency would exist.  Only half of the PK in STREETS is mapped to an FK and 2nd 
				Normal Form would have been violated.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3rd</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Each table must satisfy 1st and 2nd Normal Form</li>
					<li>No transitive functional dependencies must exist - a change in a non-key column forces a change in another 
					non-key column</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
				<img src="images/new_address.jpg" alt="New Parent Table">
				<p>In the example above, a SUFFIX field has been added.  Imagine a row is referencing Mr. Bob Crane.  
				If we change the NAME to Betsy Crane, the SUFFIX will also need to be changed to Ms.  This would violate 
				3rd Normal Form.</p>

				<p>The above proposes several violations of normalization.  The ERD to the left is a suggestion as to a schema 
				that exists in 3rd Normal Form.</p>
				<p>Notice:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Every table has one, and only one, primary key.</li>
				<li>Every column only has one specific piece of data.  (Atomic) </li>
				<li>Child table has been created to eliminate multiple children columns. </li>
				<li>No transitive functional dependencies exist </li>
